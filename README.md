# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Exercises

This repository contains selected exercises completed as part of an
"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" university course.

The purpose of these tasks was to understand fundamental AI and machine
learning algorithms and to analyze their behavior on data,
rather than to build production-ready systems.

## Implemented Algorithms

The exercises include implementations of the following algorithms:

1. Genetic Algorithm  
2. Alpha-Beta Pruning  
3. Decision Tree (ID3)  
4. Gradient Descent  
5. Two-layer Perceptron  
6. Q-learning  
7. Naive Bayes Classifier

Each task focuses on understanding the algorithm’s principles,
limitations, and practical behavior in simplified scenarios.
